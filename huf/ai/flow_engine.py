"""
Huf Flow Engine -- the ``FlowRuntime`` adapter over the shared graph executor.

Execution itself lives in :mod:`huf.ai.graph.executor`, which both this module
and (T-23) ``ProcedureRuntime`` drive. This module is the Flow-profile adapter:
it owns the ``Flow Definition`` / ``Flow Run`` documents, the twelve Flow node
executors, Flow's realtime events, and Flow's approval lifecycle -- and nothing
about how a graph is walked.

What changed in T-22, and why (defect ids are from the track plan):

* **F-1 -- versioning.** ``Flow Definition.version`` was an integer bumped on
  every save, with no content identity, and ``run_flow`` re-fetched the
  *current* definition every time -- so a run resumed after an edit executed
  the new graph. A run now pins an immutable, content-addressed
  :class:`~huf.ai.graph.executor.PinnedVersion` (see :func:`_pinned_version`)
  and executes that exact graph for its whole life.
* **F-2 -- interpolation.** Four divergent ``{{...}}`` implementations with
  different semantics per node type are gone; there is no string templating
  left in the engine at all. Every node type resolves its config exclusively
  through the executor's single structured reference form,
  ``{"$from": "node.path"}`` (see :meth:`~huf.ai.graph.executor.GraphContext.resolve`),
  with :func:`_resolve_context_path` still used for a plain dotted-path
  read (``transform``'s copy/map/template operations).
* **F-3 -- loops.** Loop iteration no longer burns the run's hop budget; a
  bounded foreach carries its own iteration budget in the executor.
* **F-4 -- concurrency.** ``run_flow`` takes a distributed lock, and the
  executor refuses to advance a run that is not in an advanceable state, so
  two concurrent callers cannot both move the same cursor.
* **F-9 -- context.** ``context_json`` was re-parsed at roughly fifteen call
  sites. It is now parsed once per run into a
  :class:`~huf.ai.graph.executor.GraphContext` carried by
  :class:`FlowRunContext` and threaded through every executor.
* **I5 -- telemetry.** ``Agent Tool Call`` records are emitted by
  ``huf.ai.tool_invocation`` (through ``flow_tool_executor``), not assembled
  here. Exactly one record per atomic operation.
