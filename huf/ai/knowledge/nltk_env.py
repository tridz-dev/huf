"""Keep LlamaIndex's bundled NLTK data off hardlinked package files.

Some environments install the Python env in a way that hardlinks package
files from a shared cache (e.g. `uv`'s default link mode). `llama_index.core`
bundles NLTK corpora under its own `_static/nltk_cache` and loads them via
`nltk.data`. Newer `nltk` releases ship a hardened `pathsec.open` that refuses
to open any file with `st_nlink > 1`, since an in-root hardlink could
otherwise point at an attacker-controlled inode outside the sandbox root
(CWE-59). That check is legitimate and we don't want to weaken it — but a
benign packaging hardlink then makes every Knowledge Source indexing attempt
fail with `Security Violation [pathsec.open]: refusing multiply-linked file`.

`ensure_writable_nltk_data()` makes indexing environment-agnostic instead of
disabling the check: it copies LlamaIndex's bundled NLTK data (a real
`shutil.copy`, which always creates a fresh inode with `st_nlink == 1`) into a
private, per-site directory the first time it's needed.

Crucially, the fix must be visible to `llama_index.core.utils.GlobalsHelper`,
which is the thing that actually loads stopwords/punkt during chunking
(`SentenceSplitter` -> `globals_helper.stopwords`/`.punkt_tokenizer`).
`GlobalsHelper.wait_for_nltk_check()` does not consult `nltk.data.path` at
all for its own lookup: it resolves a single `_nltk_data_dir` (the `NLTK_DATA`
env var if set, else its bundled `_static/nltk_cache`) and calls
`nltk.data.find(..., paths=[self._nltk_data_dir])` with that *explicit*,
narrowed search path -- so merely prepending to `nltk.data.path` (which is
what a plain `nltk.corpus.stopwords.words()` call consults) never reaches
this lookup, and the hardlinked file is still what gets opened. Setting the
`NLTK_DATA` environment variable is what actually redirects it, so we set
that (in addition to `nltk.data.path`, for any other caller that does honor
it) before `GlobalsHelper` is ever touched.
